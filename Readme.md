Project: Netwhat will allow you to discover the network and to learn about its inner workings.
This will allow you to understand how some things work that you already use in your
everyday life.

In the Wiki you can find my research on netwhat

Here is a good test to find out if you have enough knowledge on the topic (thanks!)

There are some good subnet calculators that you can get in the app-store or find online. You need them to calculate network adresses etc.
